# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains all Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.

## Naming Convention

Notebooks should be named according to the following convention:

`[topic]_[analysis-type]_[brief-description].ipynb`

Example: `aerators_relative-efficiency-profitability_financials.ipynb`

## Structure Guidelines

Each notebook should:

1. Begin with a markdown cell containing the title, author, and date
2. Include an "Overview" or "Abstract" section that explains the purpose of the analysis
3. Document data sources clearly
4. Include appropriate comments and markdown explanations
5. End with conclusions and next steps
