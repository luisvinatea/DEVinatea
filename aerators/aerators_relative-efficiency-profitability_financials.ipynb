    "\n",
    "Aerator selection is a critical economic decision in shrimp farming, often complicated by the trade-off between initial cost and long-term operational efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis comparing two aerator options within the context of a specific shrimp farm, integrating Léon Walras's General Equilibrium Theory and Friedrich von Wieser's concept of Opportunity Cost. The study evaluates aerators based on updated technical performance metrics (including Temperature-Adjusted Oxygen Transfer Rate - OTR_T and Standard Aeration Efficiency - SAE) derived from the farm's Total Oxygen Demand (TOD) and detailed, adapted financial indicators (Net Present Value - NPV, Internal Rate of Return - IRR, Payback Period, Return on Investment - ROI, Profitability Index - k, Opportunity Cost, and Equilibrium Price) tailored for equipment comparison. Results from the specific case study demonstrate that prioritizing higher efficiency (Aerator 2) over lower initial cost (Aerator 1) leads to substantial long-term savings, a significantly positive NPV, high interpreted ROI and IRR, rapid payback, and a considerable opportunity cost associated with choosing the less efficient option. The analysis highlights the economic fallacy of prioritizing low initial costs over efficiency and underscores the importance of applying robust economic principles and adapted technical-financial assessments for optimizing operational costs and ensuring financial sustainability in shrimp aquaculture (Boyd & Hanson, 2021; The Fish Site, 2021).\n",

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The economic analysis of optimal aerator choice in shrimp farming benefits from the General Equilibrium Theorem developed by Léon Walras in the 19th century, complemented by Friedrich von Wieser's concept of opportunity cost, introduced in 1914. Walras proposed a framework to understand how interconnected markets reach simultaneous equilibrium, where supply equals demand through relative prices (Walras, 1874). This approach is useful for analyzing complex systems like shrimp farms, where multiple \"markets\" (oxygen, energy, shrimp, operating costs) interact to maximize profitability (Asche et al., 2021). Opportunity cost measures the value of the best alternative forgone, evaluating aerator options (Boyd & Hanson, 2021).\n"

    "## 1.1 Analogy with the Oxygen Market and Opportunity Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "In shrimp farming, dissolved oxygen is a critical input. An \"internal oxygen market\" can be conceptualized where demand (Total Oxygen Demand, TOD) is driven by shrimp and microbial needs, and supply depends on aerators' Temperature-Adjusted Oxygen Transfer Rate (OTR_T). Aerators interact with energy, maintenance, and replacement markets, connecting to the external shrimp market. Walras's Theorem suggests equilibrium when these markets adjust simultaneously. Choosing a cheaper, less efficient aerator incurs an opportunity cost equal to the net present value of savings forgone by not selecting the more efficient option (Boyd & Hanson, 2021; Susilowati et al., 2021).\n"

    "\n",
    "Assuming a fixed horsepower (HP)-per-production ratio is erroneous. Shrimp production depends on multiple factors (dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, density). Aerator HP does not directly equate to oxygen supply; OTR_T is critical. Fixed HP ratios ignore interdependencies, leading to inefficient investments in low-OTR_T aerators and significant opportunity costs (Boyd, 2015; Responsible Seafood Advocate, 2022).\n"

    "Walras formalized general equilibrium with supply/demand equations, subject to Walras's Law (excess demands sum to zero). Equilibrium prices are found via \"tâtonnement\" (Walras, 1874). In shrimp farming, equilibrium involves optimizing aerator costs, meeting TOD, maximizing profits, and accounting for opportunity cost (Asche et al., 2021; Valderrama et al., 2023).\n"

    "\n",
    "The analysis demonstrates Aerator 2's economic superiority despite its higher unit cost ($900 vs $700) (Boyd & Hanson, 2021; The Fish Site, 2021). Key findings include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency Advantage:** Aerator 2's higher SAE (1.56 vs 0.85 kg O₂/kWh) reduces equipment needs by 45% (2,367 vs 4,356 units) (Kumar et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2024).\n",
    "2. **Lower Initial Investment:** Fewer units result in a lower total investment for Aerator 2 ($2.13M vs $3.05M).\n",
    "3. **Annual Savings:** Aerator 2 saves $1,913,231 annually, driven by reduced energy and replacement costs (Boyd & Hanson, 2021; The Fish Site, 2021).\n",
    "4. **Financial Metrics:** NPV of savings is $14.6M, with relative ROI of 150.42% and IRR of 343.93%, indicating immediate benefits (Intelligon, 2022; Susilowati et al., 2021).\n",
    "5. **Opportunity Cost:** Choosing Aerator 1 incurs a $14.6M opportunity cost (Boyd & Hanson, 2021).\n",
    "6. **Equilibrium Price:** Aerator 1's price would need to be negative ($9,082 threshold) to compete, highlighting its inefficiency (Asche et al., 2021).\n",

    "\n",
    "This study reinforces that prioritizing upfront cost savings over operational efficiency (SAE, OTR_T) and durability is economically detrimental. Comprehensive, adapted mathematical models (NPV, opportunity cost, equilibrium pricing) provide decision support for sustainable shrimp farm management (Engle, 2010; Merino et al., 2024).\n"
